<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I am a student currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Design 
from Madhav Institute of Technology in Gwalior. I completed my 12th standard from Gurukul Senior 
Secondary School in Rewa. I am originally from Rewa,Madhya Pradesh, India.
In my free time, I enjoy listening to music and discovering new artists. I also have 
a keen interest in app development and I am currently learning new skills in this area. I find the 
process of creating and launching an app to be exciting and rewarding, and I am constantly seeking 
out new challenges to develop my skills further.</p>
<p>Apart from my academic pursuits, I enjoy traveling and exploring new places. I have 
been fortunate enough to have visited several beautiful locations within India and I hope to continue 
traveling and experiencing new cultures in the future. I also love gaming and spending time with my 
friends and family.
Overall, I am a curious and ambitious individual who is passionate about technology 
and creativity. I am always seeking new opportunities to learn and grow, and I believe that my 
education and interests will help me achieve my goals and make a positive impact on the world around
